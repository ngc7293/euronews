# euronews

Downloads the Euronews livestream so you can watch it from your favorite media player.
Once the script is started, give let it run for a few seconds and then open the `euronews.ts` file in your media player (`mpv` works perfectly).

The script prompts for a stream quality, but you can also pass it a `--quality` argument. Quality is in vertical pixels (e.g.: `--quality 720` for 720p)
